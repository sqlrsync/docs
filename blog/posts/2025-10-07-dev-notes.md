## Push `--subscribe` experiment

Today we released [v0.0.6 of the SQLRsync Client](https://sqlrsync.com/download) which introduces the experimental `--subscribe` flag when referencing a LOCAL ORIGIN and REMOTE REPLICA. When enabled, after a delay to coalesce writes and allow the disk to flush configured with `--waitIdle=<duration>`, the client will automatically push up changes which will replicate out to subscribers.

This new feature introduces some new flags for configuring automatic pushes:

- `--subscribe` - Enables automatic pushes to subscribers - requires a Push or Admin Key
- `--waitIdle=<duration>` - Configures the duration of idle time after a local write to push up changes (minimum 10s)
- `--maxInterval=<duration>` - Configures the maximum interval to check-in and push up changes to confirm things are in sync (like 24h)
- `--minInterval=<duration>` - Configures the minimum interval between pushes to avoid spamming (like 1m)

These new flags accept a `<duration>`, which is a number followed by a unit, such as `2s`, `5m`, or `1h`.

## Content Security Policy and OWASP Improvements

In addition to the new client features, we have also improved the security of the SQLRsync.com web site by implementing a strict [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and continuing to implement recommendations based on the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). These changes help protect against common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.

It also means some things have broken (the animations on the front page are a key example).  I'm working to fix these issues while continually improving a strong security posture.
