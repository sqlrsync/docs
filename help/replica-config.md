title: Replica Config
---

Remember: A Replica is a SQLite Database stored in SQLRsync. A Namespace is a collection of Replicas.

The Replica Config is still being developed. For the moment you can:

- Rename the replica
- Rotate access keys
- View logs
- Delete the replica

In the future you'll be able to adjust automatic naming, retention policies, alarms, and more.

### To view a Replica Config:

1. Visit your [Namespaces Page](/namespaces)
2. Click on (or the View button for ) one of your Namespaces
3. Click on a Database from the list
4. In the toolbar across the top of the page, click "Config"
